    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Thalia Bacilio and these are some facts that I want you to know about me. Iâ€™m a junior graphic design in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. For me, design is problem solving in a visual way; the two main elements are the aesthetics and purpose. Something that I really enjoy to create and express myself through illustrations, it is like a vibrant, childish, surrealism dreamworld.</p>
